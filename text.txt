Check if the File Exists Before Opening: You can first check if the file exists using 
the os.path.exists() function from the os module. If the file doesn't exist, then you 
can create it.

import os

filename = "New.txt"
if not os.path.exists(filename):
    f = open(filename, "x")
    f.close()
else:
    print(f"The file '{filename}' already exists.")
Use "w" Mode Instead of "x": If you want to create the file regardless of whether it
exists or not, you can use the "w" mode instead of the "x" mode. The "w" mode will 
create the file if it doesn't exist and truncate (clear) it if it does.

f = open("New.txt", "w") f.close() 
Remember to always close the file using the .close() method after you're done working 
with it to free up system resources.

In either case, after you've created or opened the file, you can proceed to read from 
or write to it as needed.
